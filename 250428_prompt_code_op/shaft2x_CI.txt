I'll analyze the part and provide machining recommendations based on the given parameters.
Key Analysis Points:

Material: Cast Iron - requires specific cutting parameters and robust machine capability
Part Size: 164 × 164 × 224 mm - large part requiring heavy duty machine
Features:

3 cylindrical surfaces (Ø160mm, Ø120mm, Ø90mm)
4 conical faces with semi-angle 0.79°
4 planar faces


Material Removal: 3,130,554.72 mm³ (52% of stock)

Calculations:
For turning operations:

Rough turning:
Length = (Stock_D - Final_D)/2 × Number_of_passes × Length
= ((164-160)/2) × 4 × 224 = 3584 mm
Conical surfaces:
Length = Cone_length × Number_of_passes
= 80 × 6 = 480 mm (per cone) × 4 cones = 1920 mm
Finish turning:
Length = Feature_length × Number_of_passes
= 224 × 2 = 448 mm

      - Large part size (224mm length, 164mm diameter)

      - Complex conical features requiring rigid setup",

  }
}
The machine selection and parameters are optimized for:

Cast iron's machining characteristics
Large part size and weight
Complex geometric features
Heavy material removal requirements
Surface finish requirements

This calculation considers safe cutting parameters for cast iron and includes adequate setup times for the heavy workpiece handling.
