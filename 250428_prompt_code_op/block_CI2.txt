I'll analyze the part and provide a detailed machining solution.
Key observations from the input:

Material: Cast Iron
Part size: 104 x 104 x 104 mm
Features: All planar faces (14 surfaces)
Material removal: 135,664 mm³ (12.1% of stock)
High material utilization: 87.9%

Let me calculate the machining requirements:
For Face Milling (100mm cutter):
Length = (W/ae + 1) × L × passes
= (104/70 + 1) × 104 × 2
= 2.49 × 104 × 2 = 518.4 mm per face
For the 14 planar faces with varying areas:

Main faces (4x ~9800mm²): 4 × 518.4 = 2073.6 mm
Secondary faces (4x ~9600mm²): 4 × 518.4 = 2073.6 mm
Small faces (6x ~1000mm² or less): 6 × 220 = 1320 mm

Total toolpath length: 5467.2 mm
Given Cast Iron cutting parameters:

Face Mill (Carbide): 180 m/min, 0.2 mm/tooth
Depth of cut: 2-3 mm per pass

The process uses a 3-axis CNC mill given:

All features are planar faces
Part size fits standard machine
Cast iron material requires robust machine
Simple fixturing requirements
Two setups adequate for all faces
