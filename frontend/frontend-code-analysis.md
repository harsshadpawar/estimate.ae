Based on my comprehensive analysis of the frontend codebase, I'll explain the step-by-step differences between server/src, shared/src, react, and assets directories:

1. Server/src Directory
Purpose: Backend server implementation using Express.js

Key Components:

ExpressServer.ts: The main server entry point that initializes the Express application
config/common: Contains server configuration for basic functionality like health checks
config/mtk-explorer: Implements API endpoints for the MTK (Manufacturing Toolkit) Explorer:
Model conversion
File handling and storage
Thumbnail generation
CAD model processing using MTKConverter executable
Primary Responsibility:

Handles HTTP requests from the frontend
Manages file operations (read/write)
Executes the MTKConverter tool for processing CAD models
Serves converted model data to the client
2. Shared/src Directory
Purpose: Cross-cutting code used by both frontend and backend

Key Components:

server-interaction: Defines API contracts between client and server
Contains interfaces and types for requests/responses
Defines endpoints using the ServerInteraction class
features: Shared business logic and data models
mtk-explorer: Data models for Manufacturing Toolkit models
common: Shared utilities and helpers
helpers: Utility functions used across the application
Primary Responsibility:

Provides type safety between frontend and backend
Defines data structures shared across the stack
Contains business logic that's common to both client and server
Acts as the "source of truth" for API contracts
3. React Directory
Purpose: Frontend web application built with React

Key Components:

src/app: Application configuration and routing
src/common: UI components and utilities specific to the frontend
src/features: Feature-specific components and logic:
Component-specific code for features like viewport, property tables, etc.
src/pages: Page components representing different views/routes
main.tsx: Application entry point
Primary Responsibility:

Provides the user interface
Handles client-side logic and state management
Makes API calls to the server using the contracts defined in shared/src
Renders 3D models using Three.js
Provides interactive tools for model viewing and manipulation
4. Assets Directory
Purpose: Static files and resources used by the application

Key Components:

MTKConverter: Contains the native executable for converting CAD models
images: Static image files used in the UI
models: Sample CAD models for demonstration
mtk_models: Processed/converted models organized by manufacturing process type
Primary Responsibility:

Stores binary resources like the MTKConverter tool
Contains sample data for the application
Serves as storage for user-uploaded and converted models
Provides static assets for the UI
Key Differences and Relationships
Server vs. Shared:
Server implements the API endpoints defined in Shared
Server uses data models from Shared
Server handles file I/O operations and process execution
React vs. Shared:
React consumes the API contracts defined in Shared
React uses the same data models as the Server (via Shared)
React provides the UI layer that visualizes the data
Assets vs. Server:
Server reads from and writes to the Assets directory
Server executes the MTKConverter tool located in Assets
Server organizes converted models in the mtk_models subdirectory
React vs. Assets:
React loads and displays models from the Assets directory (via Server APIs)
React may reference static images directly from Assets
This architecture follows a well-structured pattern that separates concerns while promoting code reuse through the shared directory. The Express server handles backend operations, the React application provides the UI, and they communicate through well-defined contracts in the shared code.
