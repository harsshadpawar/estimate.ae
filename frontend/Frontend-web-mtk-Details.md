# **Complete CAD Exchanger Code Stack Analysis**

Based on my analysis of the entire codebase, here's a comprehensive explanation of the complete code stack, covering both the backend and frontend components:

## **1\. Overall Architecture**

The codebase follows a modern, well-structured architecture with clear separation of concerns:

* Backend: Python-based processing engine with CAD Exchanger SDK integration  
* Frontend: React-based web application with 3D visualization capabilities  
* Server Layer: Express.js server that connects the frontend to the backend  
* Shared Code: TypeScript interfaces and models shared between frontend and server

The system is designed to analyze 3D CAD models for various manufacturing processes, visualize them, and provide detailed analysis.

## **2\. Backend (Python) Components**

The backend is organized into specialized modules, each handling specific manufacturing analysis:

### **2.1. MTKConverter**

* Core Component: The central hub that coordinates different manufacturing analyses  
* Technology: Python with CAD Exchanger SDK integration  
* Purpose: Converts CAD models into analyzable formats and coordinates processing  
* Key Files:  
  * MTKConverter.py: Main entry point  
  * mtk\_license.py: License management for CAD Exchanger SDK  
  * Various processor modules (e.g., MTKConverter\_MachiningProcessor.py)

### **2.2. Manufacturing Analysis Modules**

Each specialized module follows a similar pattern with feature recognition and DFM analysis:

* Machining: CNC machining analysis (milling/turning)  
* Sheet Metal: Sheet metal feature recognition and unfolding  
* Molding: Injection molding analysis  
* Wall Thickness: Analysis of component wall thickness  
* Nesting: Optimizing part layout for manufacturing  
* Projector: 3D to 2D projection utilities

### **2.3. Helpers**

* Utility classes for processing shapes and managing feature groups  
* Shared functionality used across different modules

## **3\. Frontend Stack**

### **3.1. Server/src Directory**

* Technology: Express.js (Node.js)  
* Purpose: Backend server implementation that bridges frontend and Python backend  
* Key Components:  
  * ExpressServer.ts: Main server entry point  
  * API endpoints for model conversion, file handling, and CAD processing  
  * Executes the MTKConverter tool and manages results  
  * Serves converted model data to the client

### **3.2. Shared/src Directory**

* Technology: TypeScript  
* Purpose: Code shared between frontend and server  
* Key Components:  
  * server-interaction: API contracts (interfaces/types for requests/responses)  
  * features: Shared business logic and data models  
  * mtk-explorer: Manufacturing Toolkit data models  
  * Provides type safety and consistent data structures

### **3.3. React Directory**

* Technology: React with TypeScript, Vite, Three.js  
* Purpose: Frontend web application  
* Key Components:  
  * src/app: Application configuration and routing  
  * src/common: Reusable UI components  
  * src/features: Feature-specific components (viewport, property tables)  
  * src/pages: Different views/routes for the application  
  * Using Three.js for 3D model rendering and interaction

### **3.4. Assets Directory**

* Purpose: Static files and resources  
* Contains:  
  * MTKConverter executable  
  * Sample CAD models  
  * Processed/converted models  
  * UI images and resources

## **4\. Data Flow and Integration**

1. Model Processing Flow:  
   * User uploads CAD file through React UI  
   * Express server receives the file and stores it in assets  
   * Server executes MTKConverter Python backend on the model  
   * Python backend performs feature recognition and analysis  
   * Results are stored as JSON and processed model files  
   * Express server serves the processed data back to the React frontend  
   * Frontend renders the 3D model with analysis results  
2. Technology Integration:  
   * TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety between frontend and server  
   * Python backend uses manufacturingtoolkit.CadExMTK SDK for CAD processing  
   * Three.js in the frontend handles 3D visualization  
   * React components provide an interactive UI for exploring results

## **5\. Key Technical Components**

* CAD Processing: CAD Exchanger SDK (manufacturingtoolkit.CadExMTK)  
* 3D Visualization: Three.js with React Three Fiber  
* UI Framework: React with Ant Design components  
* API Layer: Express.js with TypeScript  
* Build Tools: Vite for frontend, npm workspaces for project organization

## **6\. Development Workflow**

* Frontend Development: npm run dev:react or npm run dev-server:react  
* Backend Execution: Python scripts for specific analyses  
* Full Stack Development: Running both server and frontend components together

This architecture follows modern best practices with clear separation of concerns, strong typing, and a modular approach that makes the system maintainable and extensible.
